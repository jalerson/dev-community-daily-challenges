# Dev Community Daily Challenges

[The Dev Community is posting coding challenges since June 28th](https://dev.to/thepracticaldev/daily-challenge-1-string-peeler-4nep), so I've decided to try them. I don't have plans do try it on a daily basis, however, I will try to fulfill all the challenges with automated tests while using TDD approach.
